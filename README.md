<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Why the leak
Well, i wanted to buy the program, but the seller scammed me for 10$ (lmao) 

and then i contacted kata#, in first goal to pay his shit program, but also to help him protect his program, which i usually do. 

he's shown disrespectful to me, so i decided to leak.

auth: 
  https://pastebin.com/HqAtHDiv < lmao
  
Actually kata don't even have a vps 

at least, the lobby crasher doesn't seem pasted lmao

### Crack

Well, now we know how the authentication is managed, just need to grab our own hwid from the memory.

I personally recreated a pastebin, to bypass (if the program have any) integrity check from pastebin.

Then, I hooked WinHttpGetProxyForUrl to modify the memory from arg a2 (aka lpcwstr) so it would change the url and redirect to my pastebin.
